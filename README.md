# UFOs

## Overview of Project
The client, Dana, is a data journalist who wishes to write a story covering her hometown, McMinnville, OR, from the angle of its famous UFO sightings.  She has provided the source data in the form of a .JS file, and wishes to allow online users to interact with the dataset via filters on a user-focused page designed in HTML.  

Primary development focused on Javascript coding and site layout.  Once the initial filter (date) was in place and successfully tested, add'l filters were added for city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
-DESCRIBE TO DANA how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

There are four primary HTML components to this webpage:

1) Page header ("UFO Sightings") & title
